"""
Listeners can listen üëÇ to the events that are fired during the execution of a test suite and react to them.
They are like a hook ü™ù into the test run, allowing us to execute code at a specific point in time during the execution.
You can use them to e.g. notify other systems about the progress of your test suite in real time.

e.g. robot --listener .\RobotListenerV3.py .\calculate\ .\DemoLibrary\ .\StaticLibrary\
